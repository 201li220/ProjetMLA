# MLAProject: Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for NLP

## Description
This project aims to reproduce the results presented in the paper titled "Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for NLP": 
http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/houlsby19a.html
The primary objective is to implement the proposed methods and assess their effectiveness in the context of natural language processing (NLP).

The paper introduces parameter-efficient transfer learning techniques for NLP tasks. It explores methods to leverage pre-trained language models effectively while minimizing the number of parameters. For detailed insights, please refer to the original paper.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into individual modules created by each participant. The final implementation, modules, and a demonstration notebook can be found in the "main" directory.

## Installation
